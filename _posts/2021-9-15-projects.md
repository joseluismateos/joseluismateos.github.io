Here I share some  of the Data Visualization projects I have been developing out of sheer curiosity! I hope you enjoy visualizing and understanding social data as much as I do.

The following two maps have been produced using the programming language R:

## Income distribution in the Barcelona province

<div>
  <iframe
      frameBorder="0"
      width="100%"
      height="800"
      src="projects/mapa_municipis2.html">
  </iframe>
</div>

## People with Higher Education as a % of total population by censal district in my hometown (El Prat de Llobregat)
The data from this map comes from [El Prat de Llobregat's open data portal](https://seu-e.cat/ca/web/elpratdellobregat/dades-obertes)

<div>
  <iframe
      frameBorder="0"
      width="60%"
      height="800"
      src="projects/test_mapa.html">
  </iframe>
</div>
